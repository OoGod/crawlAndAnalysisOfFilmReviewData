Big data has been characterized by five dimensions: volume
(quantity/amount of data), velocity (speed of data generation), variety
(type, nature, and format of data), veracity (trustworthiness/quality of
captured data), and value (insights and impact). We organized the five
dimensions into a stack, consisting of big, data, and value layers
starting from the bottom (see Fig. 3). The big layer is the most
fundamental and the data layer is central to big data, and the value
aspect characterizes impact of big data real world applications. The
lower layer (e.g., volume and velocity) depends more heavily on
technological advances, and higher layer (e.g., value) is more oriented
toward applications that harness the strategic power of big data. In
order to realize the value of big data analytics and to process big data
efficiently, existing ML paradigms and algorithms need to be adapted.
